Usage:

`ascii art.bmp art.txt`
`inverse art.txt art.bmp`
`bonus art.bmp art.html`

Note for inverse:
Only the following characters are recognised:
' ', '.', '+', '*', 'X', '%', '#', '@'

If there is any unrecognised character, it will be ignored and proceed to the next character.
So "new line" character is actually useless in the input file.
